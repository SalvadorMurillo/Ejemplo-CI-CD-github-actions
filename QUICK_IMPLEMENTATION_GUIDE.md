# Quick Implementation Guide

## Features Implemented

### 1. Block Inactive Users from System Access ✅

**What was changed:**

- Modified `lib/services/database_service.dart`
- Added active user checks in `signIn()` and `getCurrentUser()` methods

**How it works:**

- When a user tries to log in, the system checks if `isActive = true`
- If `isActive = false`, user is immediately signed out and shown error message
- Existing sessions for inactive users are terminated automatically

**Admin Usage:**

- Deactivate users through the User Management module
- Inactive users cannot log in or maintain active sessions

---

### 2. CURP Document Upload Feature ✅

**What was changed:**

- Added fields to `Student` model: `curpDocumentUrl`, `curpDocumentUploadDate`
- Added upload methods to `FileService`
- Enhanced Add/Edit Student screen with upload UI
- Created database migration script

**How it works:**

- When creating/editing a student, users can now upload CURP documentation
- Three upload options: Camera, Gallery, or Document file
- Upload date is automatically recorded
- Documents stored in Supabase storage under `documents/curp-documents/{studentId}/`

**User Workflow:**

1. Navigate to Add/Edit Student screen
2. Fill in CURP field
3. See new "Documento CURP" section below CURP field
4. Click Camera, Gallery, or Document button to upload
5. Selected file displays with option to change
6. Save student - document uploads automatically

## Required Actions

### 1. Database Migration (REQUIRED)

Run the SQL script in Supabase:

```sql
-- File: curp_document_migration.sql

ALTER TABLE public.students
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS curp_document_url TEXT;

ALTER TABLE public.students
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS curp_document_upload_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.students.curp_document_url IS 'URL del documento o foto del CURP (para casos de cambio de CURP)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.students.curp_document_upload_date IS 'Fecha en que se subió el documento CURP';
```

**How to run:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Paste the migration script
4. Click "Run" or press F5

### 2. Storage Bucket Configuration (VERIFY)

Ensure the `documents` bucket exists and has proper policies:

**Bucket Name:** `documents`

**Recommended Policies:**

- Allow authenticated users to upload files
- Allow authenticated users to view files
- Restrict deletion to admin roles only

**To verify:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage
3. Check if `documents` bucket exists
4. Review and update policies if needed
